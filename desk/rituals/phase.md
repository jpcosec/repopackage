# Phase ritual for dependency-layer execution

Run one horizontal layer of repopackage tasks whose prerequisites are satisfied and whose
planned changes do not overlap, then close the layer with integration validation,
pill reconciliation, and next-phase preparation.

Each task in the phase still closes with its own validation and its own commit;
the phase adds the pass that only makes sense once those tasks are integrated.
